  # Anti-Swear Filter Customization Guide:
  #
  # Adding Custom Swear Words:
  # - Use /chatfilter add "(?i)\\b(yourword|variation)\\b"
  # - Example: /chatfilter add "(?i)\\b(noob|newb)\\b"
  #
  # Removing Default Rules:
  # - Use /chatfilter remove "pattern" to remove specific rules
  # - Example: /chatfilter remove "(?i)\\b(damn|damned|dammit)\\b"
  #
  # Pattern Examples:
  # - Simple word: "(?i)\\bwordhere\\b"
  # - Multiple variations: "(?i)\\b(word1|word2|word3)\\b"
  # - With substitutions: "(?i)\\b(w[o0@]rd|w\\*rd)\\b"
  # - Partial matching: "(?i)badword" (matches anywhere in message)
  #
  # Testing Patterns:
  # - Enable debug mode above to see which patterns trigger
  # - Test with staff accounts that have bypass permissions
  # - Use /chatfilter list to see all active rules
